# h3rs
An experiment in oxidizing [Uber's `h3` library](https://github.com/uber/h3). My goal is to try to port the entire library over to pure Rust.

This code is being ported from [commit a4fda8e01163e8d06800a249cb469deea2eb111e](https://github.com/uber/h3/tree/a4fda8e01163e8d06800a249cb469deea2eb111e). My plan is to get this crate implemented from there then apply future commits on top of this.
